## Choropleth map

```State transaction map
I have created a choropleth map using plotly to map the total transactions
happened in each state by each quarter of every year. From this, we can 
infer the volume of transactions and their growth in each state.

```District transaction map
This is created in overlapping of the choropleth map with district wise 
transaction using scatter geo. It will mainly gives a deep meaning of
transaction development in various cities.
